ifTrue: alternativeBlock
	"If the receiver is false (i.e., the condition is false), then the value is the false
	alternative, which is nil.  Otherwise answer the result of evaluating the argument,
	alternativeBlock.  Create an error if the receiver is nonBoolean.  Execution does not
	actually reach here because the expression is compiled in-line."
