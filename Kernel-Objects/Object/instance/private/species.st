species
	"Answer the preferred class for reconstructing the receiver.  For example,
	collections create new collections whenever enumeration messages such as
	collect: or select: are invoked.  The new kind of collection is determined by
	the species of the original collection.  Species and class are not always the
	same.  For example, the species of Interval is Array."
