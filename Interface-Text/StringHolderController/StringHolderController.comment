I represent a ParagraphEditor for a single paragraph of text, omitting alignment commands.  I provide items in the yellow button menu so that the text selection can be evaluated and so that the contents of the model can be stored or restored.
	doIt -- evaluate the text selection as an expression
	printIt -- same as doIt but insert a description of the result after the selection
	accept -- store the contents of the StringHolder into the model
	cancel -- store the contents of the model into the StringHolder

Instance Variables:
	isLockingOn	<Boolean> true if the view has been editted so that it should not
					be closed without warning the user.
