This subclass of the paragraphEditor uses actionMenus for model control protocol.
It also makes a stab (localMenuItem:) at the problem of distinguishing user control
directed at the model from that directed at the view/controller.

This controller is more tightly connected to its view (for example it asks it for its
yellowButtonMenu), because the view is the current site for "pluggable" parameterization.
