The compiler accepts Smalltalk source code from sourceStream, and compiles it in the context of a given class.  The debugger supplies a context as well, so that temporary variables are accessible.  If there is an error, the requestor (usually a CodeController) is sent the message notify:at:in:.  If not, then the result of compilation is a parse tree (made up of subinstances of ParseNode) whose root is a MethodNode.  The parse tree can then generate code in a CompiledMethod (for compile or evaluate), or prettyPrint the code (for format), or produce a map from object code back to source code (used by debugger pc selection).  See also Parser, Encoder, ParseNode.
