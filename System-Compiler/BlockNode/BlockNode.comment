I represent a bracketed block with 0 or more arguments and 1 or more statements.  If I am initialized with no statements, I create one.  I have a flag to tell whether my last statement returns a value from the enclosing method.  My last three fields remember data needed for code generation.

I can emit for value in the usual way, in which case I create a literal method (actually a context remotely copied) to be evaluated by sending it value: at run time.  Or I can emit code to be evaluated in line; this only happens at the top level of a method and in conditionals and while-loops, none of which have arguments.
