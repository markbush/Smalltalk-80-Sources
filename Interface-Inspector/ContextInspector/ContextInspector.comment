I represent a query path into the internal representation of a ContextPart.  Typically this is a context at a point in the query path of a Debugger.  As a StringHolder, the string I represent is the value of the currently selected variable of the observed temporary variable of the context.

Instance Variables:
	contextCode	<String> the method whose activation is being inspected
	tempNames	<Array> of Strings, each the name of a temporary variable.
