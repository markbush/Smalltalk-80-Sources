I represent a selection setting and actions to take depending on a change in the setting.  An instance of me has three attributes:  state, which is either on or off;  on action;  and off action.  The on and off actions are blocks of code that execute whenever the instance changes state.  I am typically used as a menu item in conjunction with a SwitchView and a SwitchController.

Instance Variables:
		on				<Boolean> true if the Switch is on
		onAction		<BlockContext> or nil
		offAction		<BlockContext> or nil
