I coordinate the interaction of a Switch, a SwitchView, and input events (user actions, see class Sensor).  My instances own a message in the form of a selector and an array of arguments.  Whenever the Switch is selected, this message is sent to the Switch.

Instance Variables:

	selector	<Symbol>
	arguments	<Array>
