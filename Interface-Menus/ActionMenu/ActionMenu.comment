ActionMenus carry an array of selectors which correspond to the listed menu items.  This allows a menu to stand alone in parameterizing a controller, since the controller just sends the selector to its model.

ActionMenus allow the pluggable views experiment (TextView, SelectionInListView) to
handle menus much easier than having pairs of variables for the menu and its associated
selectors.  Obviously these menus eagerly await a proper objectification of protocol.
