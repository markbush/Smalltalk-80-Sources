This subclass of PopUpMenu carries a list of selectors corresponding to the various menu items.
Therefore, with only the menu as a parameter, a controller can display the menu and then
tell its model to perform the associated selector.  This saves maintaining two parallel structures,
one for the names in the menu, and one for the selectors to be performed.
