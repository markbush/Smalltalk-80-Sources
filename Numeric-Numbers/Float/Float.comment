I represent floating-point numbers in IEEE 32-bit format.

These floating-point numbers are good for about 8 or 9 digits of accuracy, and the range is between plus and minus 10^32.
Here are some valid floating-point examples:
	8.0   13.3   0.3   2.5e6   1.27e-30  1.27e-31 -12.987654e12
Mainly: no imbedded blanks, little e for tens power, and a digit on both sides of the decimal point.
