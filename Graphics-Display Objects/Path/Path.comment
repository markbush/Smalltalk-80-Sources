This is the basic superclass of the Graphic Spatial Primitives.  Spatial Primitives are used to generate "trajactories" or paths like lines and circles.  The
instance variable form is the "brush" used for displaying the Path:  the image is accomplished by displaying the form at each point in the Path.
