offset
	"There are basically two kinds of display objects in the system:  those that, when
	asked to transform themselves, create a new object;  and those that side effect
	themselves by maintaining a record of the transformation request (typically
	an offset).  Path, like Rectangle and Point, is a display object of the first kind."
