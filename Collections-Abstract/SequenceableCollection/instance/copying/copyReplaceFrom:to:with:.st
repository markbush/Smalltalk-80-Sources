copyReplaceFrom: start to: stop with: replacementCollection
	"Answer a copy of the receiver satisfying the following conditions:

	If stop is less than start, then this is an insertion;
		stop should be exactly start-1,
		start = 1 means insert before the first character,
		start = size+1 means append after last character.
	Otherwise, this is a replacement;
		start and stop have to be within the receiver's bounds."
