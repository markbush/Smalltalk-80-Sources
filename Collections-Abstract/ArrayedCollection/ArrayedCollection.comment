I am an abstract collection of elements with integers as external keys.  I re-implement several messages inherited from SequenceableCollection in order to obtain some performance gains.
		Subclasses are
	Array		 elements are pointers
	ByteArray	elements are bytes
	RunArray	elements are typically runs of the same thing
	String		elements are characters
	Text		elements are characters with style
	WordArray		elements are words
