I am a kind of StringHolderController (a ParagraphEditor that adds the doIt, printIt, accept, and cancel commands).  The commands doIt and printIt are omitted.  I provide one additional menu command
	enter -- replace the current project by the model, thereby "entering" the door
			to a new office or work area
