I represent a Stream that accesses a FilePage from a File.  One use for my instance is to access larger "virtual Strings" than can be stored contiguously in main memory.  I restrict the objects stored and retrieved to be Integers or Characters.  An end of file pointer terminates reading;  it can be extended by writing past it, or the file can be explicitly truncated.

To use the file system for most applications, you typically create a FileStream.  This is done by sending a message to a FileDirectory (file:, oldFile:, newFile:, rename:newName:) which creates an instance of me.  Accesses to the file are then done via my instance.

Instance variables
	page			<FilePage> the current FilePage being accessed
	rwmode			<Integer> denoting readOnly, readWrite, or readWriteShorten.
					readWriteShorten with textual contents is the default.
	closed			<Boolean> false if the file is open
