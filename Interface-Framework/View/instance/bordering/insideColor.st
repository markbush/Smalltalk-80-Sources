insideColor
	"Answer the inside color of the receiver. The inside color determines the color of
	the inside of the receiver, which is the area inside the receiver's window excluding
	the border. The inside color is initially nil (meaning transparent), which
	means that when the receiver is displayed, the inside region will not be affected."
