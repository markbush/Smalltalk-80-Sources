WindowingTransformation is used to transform objects from a source coordinate system to a destination coordinate system.  WindowingTransformation contains a scale and a translation which can be applied to objects that respond to scaleBy: and translateBy:.  An instance of WindowingTransformation can be created with a default identity scale and translation, or with a specified scale and translation, or with a scale and translation computed from a window (a Rectangle in the source coordinate system) and a viewport (a Rectangle in the destination coordinate system).  In applying a WindowingTransformation to an object, the object is first scaled (around the origin of the source coordinate system) and then translated.  WindowingTransformations can be composed to form a single compound transformation.
