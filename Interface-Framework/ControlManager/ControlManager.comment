I represent the top level control over scheduling which controller of a view on the screen the user is actively using.  ScheduledControllers is the global reference to an instance of me, the one attached to the Project currently being used.

Instance Variables:
	scheduledControllers	<OrderedCollection> of Controllers, usually ScheduledControllers
	activeController		<Controller> usually a ScheduledController
	activeControllerProcess	<Process>
	screenController 	<ScreenController> also appears in ScheduledControllers
