	"Store the value argument into a literal in the receiver.   An index of 2
	corresponds to the first literal.  Fails if the index is less than 2 or greater than
	the number of literals.  Answer the value as the result.  Normally only the
	compiler sends this message, because only the compiler stores values in
	CompiledMethods.  Essential.  See Object documentation whatIsAPrimitive."
