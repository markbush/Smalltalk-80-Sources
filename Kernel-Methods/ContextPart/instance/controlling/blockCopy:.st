blockCopy: numArgs
	"Distinguish a block of code from its enclosing method by creating a new
	BlockContext for that block.  The compiler inserts into all methods that contain
	blocks the bytecodes to send the message blockCopy:.  Do not use blockCopy: in
	code that you write!  Only the compiler can decide to send the message
	blockCopy:.  Fail if numArgs is not a SmallInteger.  Optional.  No Lookup.  See
	Object documentation whatIsAPrimitive."
