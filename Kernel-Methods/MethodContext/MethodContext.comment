My instances hold all the dynamic state associated with the execution of a CompiledMethod.  In addition to their inherited state, this includes the receiver, a method, and temporary space in the variable part of the context.

MethodContexts, though normal in their variable size, are actually only used in two sizes, small and large, which are determined by the temporary space required by the method being executed.

Instance Variables:  *indexed*
	method			<CompiledMethod>
	receiverMap		unused (we expect to use it later for multiple inheritance)
	receiver			<Object>
