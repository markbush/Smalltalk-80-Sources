Instance Variables:
	stream	<WriteStream> accumulates symbolic output
	oldPC	<integer> remembers where current instruction started

An InstructionPrinter can print the object code of a CompiledMethod in symbolic format.  It prints into stream, and uses oldPC to know how many bytes to print in the listing.
The inherited variable "sender" is used in an ugly way to hold the method being printed.
