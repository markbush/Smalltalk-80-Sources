Instance Variables:
	class		<ClassDescription> the class being read in
	category	<String> the category for methods being read in

I am created during fileIn in response to "class methodsFor: cat" message.  I subsequently scan consecutive "chunks" from the fileIn stream and ask class to compile them in this category.  I continue in this way until an empty chunk is found.
