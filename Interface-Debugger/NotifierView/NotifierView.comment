I am a view of interrupted machine state.  The interruption occurred in order to notify the user that some action to be taken is dangerous, perhaps because it is not recoverable. I contain one subView in which the notification information is displayed.  My default controller is NotifierController.

Instance Variables:
	contents	 <String> the notification information
