Instance Variables:
	superclass	<Behavior> links the chain of inheritance
	methodDict	<IdentityDictionary> associates message names with methods
	format		<Integer> encodes storage layout of instances
	subclasses	<Set> back-pointers to the class' subclasses

Behavior provides the minimum state necessary for compiling methods, and creating and running instances.  Most objects are created as instances of the more fully supported subclass, Class, but Behavior is a good starting point for providing instance-specific behavior (as in Metaclass).
