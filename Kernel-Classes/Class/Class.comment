My instances describe the representation and behavior of objects.  I add more comprehensive programming support facilities to the basic attributes of Behavior and the descriptive facilities of ClassDescription.  An example is accessing shared (pool) variables.

Instance Variables:
		name		<Symbol> name of class for printing and global reference
		classPool	<Dictionary> of variables common to all instances
		sharedPools	<Array> of Dictionaries access to other shared variables
