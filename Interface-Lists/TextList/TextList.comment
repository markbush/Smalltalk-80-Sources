TextList is a subclass of Paragraph which is a more efficient representation of lists.
Since it displays a list of items, it does not try to produce a single string with CRs,
but instead simply makes up TextLineIntervals on the fly as needed by the view.
The major savings come from not needing to make up a new string for the whole list
and not having to measure the lines, since it is assumed that if they are too long,
they will simply be clipped rather than wrapping to the next line.
