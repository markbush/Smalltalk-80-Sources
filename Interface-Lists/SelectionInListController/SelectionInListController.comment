This controllers is designed to support the pluggable SelectionInListViews (q.v.).
As its operation is parameterized in the view, it must ask its view for current
selection and for menu options.  The tighter controller/view relationship appropriate to
pluggable viewing has not yet fully matured.  Note that control is not accepted
if the view is empty.
