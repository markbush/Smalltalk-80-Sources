I represent a true/false (yes/no) choice.  My instances have two possible actions they can take, depending on which choice is made.

Instance variables
	trueAction	<BlockContext>	sequence of expression to do if positive choice is made
	falseAction	<BlockContext>	sequence of expression to do if negative choice is made
	actionTaken	<Boolean> was the action, true or false, already taken
