I represent a single change of some kind.  I have many subclasses for specific kinds of changes.  The text which represents me is a chunk of a file starting at a particular position.

Since so many kinds of changes are related to classes, categories, and methods, there are dummy accessing methods for these parameters in class Change.

Instance variables:
	file <FileStream>
	position <Integer>
